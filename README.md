# GoEMS
Engine Management System for Go

System Overview:

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): Provides a set of standardized interfaces for interacting with the microcontroller hardware, making it easier to port the EMS code to different microcontrollers.

Configuration Module: Reads configuration files and initializes the EMS system with the appropriate settings for the engine type, number of cylinders, forced induction, sequential injection, variable valve timing, and electronic throttle control.

Data Acquisition Module: Reads data from sensors on the engine and converts it into a format that can be used by the EMS system. Provides real-time feedback to the driver, such as RPM, throttle position, and engine temperature.

Control Module: Uses data from the data acquisition module to make decisions about how to control the engine. Uses a set of algorithms and lookup tables to calculate the appropriate fuel injection timing, ignition timing, and other parameters.

Simulation and Testing Module: Allows the EMS system to be tested in a simulated environment, using a virtual engine model that can be configured to match different engine types, number of cylinders, forced induction, sequential injection, variable valve timing, and electronic throttle control.
