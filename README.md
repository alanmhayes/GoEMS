## GoEMS: An Engine Management System written in Go

GoEMS is an open-source Engine Management System (EMS) that is designed to be easily configurable for different engine types, number of cylinders, forced induction, sequential injection, variable valve timing, and electronic throttle control. The system is written in Go, a fast and efficient programming language that is well-suited for embedded systems and microcontrollers.

**Overview**

GoEMS is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing it to be customized and adapted to a wide range of different engine configurations and use cases. The system is built around several core modules, including:

 - **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** Provides a uniform interface for interacting with different hardware platforms and
   microcontrollers.
   
 - **Configuration Module:** Allows users to configure the system for their specific engine configuration and requirements, including
   engine type, number of cylinders, forced induction, fuel system,
   ignition system, calibration, and parser.
   
 - **Data Acquisition Module:** Captures sensor data from the engine and provides it to the Control Module for analysis and processing.

 - **Control Module:** Processes sensor data and generates control signals for the various engine components, including fuel injectors,
   ignition coils, and electronic throttle control.
   
 - **Target Module:** Determines the desired engine load and other operating parameters based on user input or other external factors,
   and provides this information to the Control Module.
   
 - **Testing Module:** Includes a variety of different testing tools and techniques that can be used to verify the correct operation and
   performance of the system.
